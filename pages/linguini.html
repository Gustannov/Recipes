    <p> The combination that is mussels and pasta is just heavenly! 
        Combining the two simple concepts perfected the creamy, 
        garlicky white wine sauce that was perfect for pasta and mussels.

    <h4>Mussels over pasta with light, yet creamy white wine sauce made with garlic, butter, fresh basil,
        Parmesan cheese, and cream. Tossed with linguine and simmered until creamy.</h4>

        <dl>Cover and simmer mussels in the white wine sauce until fully cooked and shells open up, 
            about 5 minutes. Stir mussels to coat in the sauce.</dl>

        <dl>When linguine is finished, strain and stir into the mussels and white wine sauce.
