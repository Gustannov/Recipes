    <h3>Preparation</h3>

    <em>Marination</em>

    <ol>
        <li>This recipe 1/2kg chicken (1.1lbs.). Make few slits on all the chicken pieces and add to a large bowl. Then add:

            <ul>
                <li>3 tablespoons of plain yoghurt (Indian curd)</li>
                <li>1.25 tablespoons of ginger garlic paste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of garam masala (or biryani masala)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground tumeric</li>
                <li>1/2 red chilli powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Mix everything well and marinate the chicken. Cover this and set aside for 1 hour 
            (or rest it overnight in the fridge)
        </li>

        <li>Meanwhile add Basmati rice into a cup and rinse it at least thrice. Drain and soak in water for 30 min.
            Drain to colander after 30 min.
            <strong>Optional-</strong> Soak a pinch of saffron strands in 2 tbsp of hot milk.
        </li>

        <h3>Cooking chicken</h3>

        <li>Heat ghee or oil in a heavy bottom pot or pressure cooker. Make sure you have a large pot for this. Using whole spices is optional but recommended:
            <ul>
                <li>1 Bay leaf </li>
                <li>4 green cardamoms</li>
                <li>6 cloves</li>
                <li>1 inch cinnamon piece</li>
                <li>1 star anise</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon caraway seeds</li>
                <li>1 strand mace</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Add thinly sliced onions. On medium heat ,fry them until they are uniformly light brown.</li>

        <li>Add marinated chicken and saute until it becomes pale for 5min</li>

        <li>Lower the flame, cover and cook until the chicken is soft, tender and completely cooked</li>

        <li>Check if the chicken is cooked by pricking with a fork or knife. It has to be just cooked and not overdone. Evaporate excess moisture in the pot by cooking further without the lid.</li>

        <li>Taste and add more salt if needed. Then add:
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup plain yoghurt (or Indian curd)</li>
                <li>1 tsp garam masala (or biryani masala)</li>
                <li>1/4 to 1/2 tsp of chilli powder(optional)</li>
                <li>1 slit green chilli pepper (optional)</li>
                <li>2 tbsp of chopped mint leaves</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <h3>Making the biryani</h3>

        <li>Mix everything well and spread evenly into a single layer</li>

        <li>Layer the drained rice all over the chicken. Into a separate bowl, pour 3 cups of water and add 1/4 tsp of salt. (If cooking in a pot, start with 3 cups of water at this stage)
            Stir and taste the water, it must be slightly salty. Pour 2 cups of this across the sides of the cooker or pot. Pour rest of the water over the rice gently. </li>

        <li>Level the rice gently on top. Add 2 tbsp of mint leaves. Do not mix up everything, the taste of biryani cooked in this method is good.
            Optionally, you can sprinkle 2 tbsp of fried onions & saffron soaked milk.</li>

        <li>Finally cover the pot or cooker.
            <strong>If cooking in a pot,</strong> cook on a medium heat until rice is cooked completely. If the rice is undercooked, pour in a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water at this stage. How much to 
            add depends on the quality of the basmati rice. cook covered until the biryani rice is perfectly done, grainy and fully cooked. Rest it covered for 15mins.
        </li>

    </ol>
